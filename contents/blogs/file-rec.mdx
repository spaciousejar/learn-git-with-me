## Introduction: Mastering Git and GitHub

Version control is an essential skill for any developer, and Git is the most widely used version control system today. GitHub, a platform built around Git, provides a collaborative environment for developers to share and manage their code. In this blog post, we'll explore the basics of Git and GitHub, and how you can start using them to manage your projects.

   git status
   ```

4. **Add Changes to Staging Area**:

   ```bash
   git add <file>
   ```

5. **Commit Changes**:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Commit message"
   ```

6. **Push Changes to Remote Repository**:

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

7. **Pull Changes from Remote Repository**:

   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

### Branching and Merging

1. **Create a New Branch**:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b new-branch
   ```

2. **Switch to a Branch**:

   ```bash
   git checkout branch-name
   ```

3. **Merge a Branch**:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge new-branch
   ```

### Using GitHub

1. **Create a Repository**:

   - Go to GitHub and click on the "New" button to create a new repository.
   - Fill in the repository name and description, and click "Create repository."

2. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
   ```

3. **Create a Pull Request**:

   - Push your branch to GitHub:

     ```bash
     git push origin new-branch
     ```
   - Go to the repository on GitHub, click on "Pull requests," and then "New pull request."
   - Select your branch and create the pull request.

4. **Review and Merge Pull Requests**:

   - Review the changes in the pull request.
   - If everything looks good, click "Merge pull request."

### Conclusion
