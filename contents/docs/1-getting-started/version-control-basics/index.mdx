## Key Concepts of Version Control

### 1. Repository
A repository (or "repo") is a storage location where your project and its history are stored. It contains all the files and the complete history of changes.

### 2. Commit
A commit is a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique identifier and contains information about what changed, who made the change, and when.

### 3. Branch
A branch is a parallel version of the repository that allows you to work on different features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.

### 4. Merge
Merging is the process of combining changes from different branches into one.

### 5. Clone
Cloning creates a local copy of a repository that exists on a remote server.

## Types of Version Control Systems

### 1. Local Version Control Systems
Simple systems that keep track of files on your local computer.

### 2. Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS)
Systems like SVN where a single server contains all versioned files, and users check out files from that central place.

### 3. Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)
Systems like Git where every user has a complete copy of the repository, including its full history.
