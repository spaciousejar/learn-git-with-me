title: Git vs Other VCS
description: Git has become the de facto standard for source control in software development, but it's not the only version control system (VCS) available. Here are some key differences between Git and other popular VCS.
---
## Git vs. Mercurial

Mercurial is a distributed VCS that uses a similar architecture to Git.

**Similarities:**
- Both are distributed version control systems
- Both allow offline work
- Both have good branching capabilities

**Differences:**
- Git has a more complex command structure but offers more flexibility
- Mercurial is generally considered easier to learn
- Git has better performance for large repositories
- Mercurial has a more centralized approach and doesn't use SHA-1 hashes in the same way as Git

## Git vs. Subversion (SVN)

Subversion is a centralized VCS that's often compared to Git.

**Similarities:**
- Both support branching and merging
- Both track file changes over time

**Differences:**
- SVN requires a central server to manage the repository
- Git allows for offline work and commits
- Git's branching and merging is significantly more powerful and efficient
- SVN tracks file changes, while Git tracks content

## Git vs. Perforce

Perforce is a commercial VCS that's designed for large-scale development projects.

**Similarities:**
- Both handle binary files
- Both support branching

**Differences:**
- Perforce uses a centralized approach
- Perforce has better built-in support for large binary files
- Git has better community support and integration with open-source tools
- Perforce includes additional features like build automation and issue tracking

## Git vs. CVS

CVS is an older version control system that's still in use today.

**Similarities:**
- Both track changes to files over time
- Both support multiple developers working on the same codebase

**Differences:**
- CVS lacks many modern features and is often considered outdated
- Git supports atomic commits (all changes are committed together or none at all)
- Git has much better branching and merging capabilities
- CVS is centralized, while Git is distributed

## Why Git Has Become the Standard

Git has become the dominant version control system for several reasons:

1. **Distributed Nature**: Every developer has a complete copy of the repository, enabling offline work and providing redundancy.

2. **Performance**: Git is designed to be fast, even with large repositories.

3. **Branching Model**: Git's lightweight branching makes it easy to create, merge, and delete branches.

4. **GitHub and Other Platforms**: The rise of GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket has made Git even more accessible and popular.

5. **Open Source**: Git is free and open-source, with a large community contributing to its development.
