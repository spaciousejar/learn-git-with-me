title: Cherry-Picking Commits
description: Cherry-picking in Git allows you to apply a specific commit from one branch to another, without merging the entire branch. This is useful when you want to bring in a specific feature or fix from one branch to another without incorporating all the changes from the source branch.
---
## Basic Usage

The basic syntax for cherry-picking is:

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

This command takes the changes introduced by the specified commit and applies them to your current branch as a new commit.

## When to Use Cherry-Pick

Cherry-picking is particularly useful in the following scenarios:

1. **Applying a bug fix to multiple branches**: When you've fixed a bug in one branch and need to apply the same fix to other branches.

2. **Selectively including features**: When you want to include specific features from a development branch without merging everything.

3. **Backporting changes**: When you need to apply a change from a newer version to an older, maintained version.

4. **Recovering lost commits**: When commits have been accidentally removed from a branch and you want to reapply them.

## Cherry-Pick Options

Git cherry-pick comes with several useful options:

- `-n` or `--no-commit`: Apply the changes without creating a commit
- `-e` or `--edit`: Edit the commit message before committing
- `-x`: Add a line "cherry picked from commit..." to the commit message
- `-s` or `--signoff`: Add a Signed-off-by line to the commit message
- `--continue`: Continue the cherry-pick operation after resolving conflicts
- `--abort`: Cancel the operation and return to the pre-sequence state
- `--quit`: Forget the current operation in progress

## Cherry-Picking Multiple Commits

You can cherry-pick a range of commits using the following syntax:

```bash
git cherry-pick <start-commit>..<end-commit>
```

Or for individual commits:

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit1> <commit2> <commit3>
```

## Handling Cherry-Pick Conflicts

When cherry-picking, conflicts might occur if the same part of a file was modified in both the current branch and the commit being cherry-picked. When this happens:

1. Git will pause the cherry-pick and show you which files have conflicts
2. Edit the files to resolve the conflicts
3. Add the resolved files with `git add <file>`
4. Continue the cherry-pick with `git cherry-pick --continue`
5. If you want to abort the cherry-pick, use `git cherry-pick --abort`

## Examples

### Cherry-picking a single commit

```bash
git cherry-pick abc123
```

### Cherry-picking without committing

```bash
git cherry-pick -n abc123
# Make additional changes if needed
git commit -m "Applied changes from abc123 with modifications"
```

### Cherry-picking a range of commits

```bash
git cherry-pick abc123..def456
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use sparingly**: Cherry-picking can lead to duplicate commits and potential confusion. Use it when necessary, but prefer merging or rebasing for most cases.

2. **Document cherry-picked commits**: Add a note in the commit message indicating that it's a cherry-pick and where it came from (the `-x` option helps with this).

3. **Be aware of dependencies**: If the commit you're cherry-picking depends on other commits, you might need to cherry-pick those as well.

4. **Test after cherry-picking**: Always verify that your code still works after cherry-picking, as the context might be different in the target branch.

## Potential Issues

### Duplicate commits

Cherry-picking creates new commits with different hashes, which can lead to duplicate changes if you later merge the branches.

### Missing context

A cherry-picked commit might miss important context from previous commits, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

### Merge conflicts

Cherry-picking can often lead to merge conflicts, especially if the target branch has diverged significantly from the source branch.
