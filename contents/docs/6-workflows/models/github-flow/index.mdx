# GitHub Flow

GitHub Flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that supports teams and projects where deployments are made regularly. It's perfect for teams that deploy frequently and want a simple workflow.

## Core Principles

1. **Main branch is always deployable**
2. **Create branches for new features**
3. **Open pull requests early**
4. **Deploy after code review**
5. **Merge after deployment**

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Create a Branch
```bash
# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication

# Push branch to GitHub
git push -u origin feature/user-authentication
```

### 2. Add Commits
```bash
# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add login form component"
git push origin feature/user-authentication

# Continue with more commits
git commit -m "Add password validation"
git push origin feature/user-authentication
```

### 3. Open Pull Request
- **Create PR** as soon as you have something to discuss
- **Add description** explaining changes
- **Request reviews** from team members
- **Use draft PRs** for work in progress

### 4. Discuss and Review Code
```markdown
# PR Review Process
1. Code review by team members
2. Automated tests run
3. Address feedback
4. Update code based on comments
5. Get approval from reviewers
```

### 5. Deploy
```bash
# Deploy feature branch to staging/production
# Test in live environment
# Verify everything works correctly
```

### 6. Merge
```bash
# After successful deployment and testing
# Merge PR to main branch
# Delete feature branch
git branch -d feature/user-authentication
```

## Branch Strategy

### Main Branch
- **Always stable** and deployable
- **Protected** with branch protection rules
- **All features** merge here
- **Automatically deployed** to production

### Feature Branches
```bash
# Naming conventions
feature/user-login
feature/shopping-cart
bugfix/login-validation
hotfix/security-patch
```

## Best Practices

### Branch Naming
```bash
# Good branch names
feature/add-payment-processing
bugfix/fix-user-registration
hotfix/security-vulnerability
refactor/update-api-endpoints
```

### Commit Messages
```bash
# Follow conventional commits
feat: add user authentication
fix: resolve login validation issue
docs: update API documentation
refactor: improve error handling
```

### Pull Request Guidelines
```markdown
# Good PR Description
## What
Add user authentication system

## Why
Users need to log in to access protected features

## How
- JWT token implementation
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Login/logout endpoints

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing completed

Closes #123
```

## Deployment Strategy

### Continuous Deployment
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: ./deploy.sh
```

### Feature Branch Deployment
```bash
# Deploy feature branch for testing
git push origin feature/new-feature
# Automatic deployment to staging environment
# Test and verify changes
# Merge to main for production deployment
```

## Advantages

### Simplicity
- **Easy to understand** and implement
- **Minimal overhead** compared to complex workflows
- **Fast iteration** and deployment cycles

### Flexibility
- **Adapt to team size** and project needs
- **Scale** from small to large teams
- **Works well** with CI/CD pipelines

### Collaboration
- **Early feedback** through pull requests
- **Code review** built into workflow
- **Knowledge sharing** across team

## When to Use GitHub Flow

### Good For:
- **Web applications** with frequent deployments
- **Teams** that want simple workflows
- **Projects** with continuous delivery
- **Startups** and agile development

### Consider Alternatives When:
- **Multiple versions** need maintenance
- **Complex release cycles** required
- **Large enterprise** environments
- **Strict regulatory** requirements

## Comparison with Git Flow

| Aspect | GitHub Flow | Git Flow |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Complexity | Simple | Complex |
| Branches | main + feature | main + develop + feature + release + hotfix |
| Deployment | Continuous | Planned releases |
| Best for | Web apps | Software releases |

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Start from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/add-user-profile

# 3. Develop feature
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add user profile component"
git push origin feature/add-user-profile

# 4. Open pull request on GitHub
# 5. Code review and discussion
# 6. Deploy to staging for testing
# 7. Merge to main
# 8. Automatic production deployment
# 9. Delete feature branch
git branch -d feature/add-user-profile
```
