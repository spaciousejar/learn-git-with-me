# PR Guidelines

Pull Request (PR) guidelines are essential for maintaining a smooth and efficient code review process in collaborative development environments. These guidelines typically outline best practices for creating, formatting, and submitting PRs, ensuring that changes are well-documented, easy to review, and align with the project's standards. They may cover aspects such as PR size, commit message formatting, documentation requirements, and testing expectations. By establishing clear PR guidelines, teams can streamline their workflow, improve code quality, and facilitate effective communication among contributors.
