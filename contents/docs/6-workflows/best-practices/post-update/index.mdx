# post-update

Git post-update hooks are scripts that run automatically after a successful push to a repository. These hooks are executed on the remote repository and are typically used for server-side tasks such as updating other services, triggering continuous integration processes, or notifying team members about changes. Post-update hooks provide a powerful mechanism for automating workflows and maintaining consistency across different parts of a project's infrastructure, making them an essential tool for streamlining development processes and enhancing collaboration in Git-based projects.
