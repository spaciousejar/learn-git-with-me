# pre-commit

Git pre-commit hooks are scripts that run automatically before a commit is created, allowing developers to enforce code quality standards and catch issues early in the development process. These hooks can perform tasks such as linting, formatting, running tests, or checking for sensitive information, ensuring that only clean and compliant code is committed to the repository. By intercepting the commit process, pre-commit hooks help maintain code consistency, reduce errors, and streamline the overall development workflow, making them a valuable tool for enforcing best practices and improving code quality across a project.
