title: Pre-push Hooks
---

Pre-push hooks run before git push operations, allowing you to validate the commits being pushed.

## Use Cases

- Run full test suite
- Check for forbidden files
- Validate branch names
- Ensure all commits are signed

## Example Hook

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-push

# Run tests before pushing
npm test
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Tests failed! Push aborted."
    exit 1
fi
```
