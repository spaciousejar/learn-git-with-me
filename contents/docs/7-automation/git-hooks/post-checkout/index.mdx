Post-checkout hooks run after git checkout operations, useful for updating the working directory based on the new branch.

## Use Cases

- Install/update dependencies
- Clear cache files
- Update configuration files
- Restart development servers

## Example Hook

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/post-checkout

# Check if package.json changed
if git diff --name-only HEAD@{1} HEAD | grep -q "package.json"; then
    echo "package.json changed, running npm install..."
    npm install
fi
```
