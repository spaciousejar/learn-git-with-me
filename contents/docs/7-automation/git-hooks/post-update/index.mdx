# Post-update Hooks

Post-update hooks run on the server after refs are updated, commonly used for deployment and notifications.

## Use Cases

- Deploy applications
- Send notifications
- Update documentation
- Trigger CI/CD pipelines

## Example Hook

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/post-update

# Deploy to production
if [[ $1 == refs/heads/main ]]; then
    echo "Deploying to production..."
    ./deploy.sh
fi
```
