# Git History Rewriting Overview

Git history rewriting is a powerful set of techniques that allows you to modify your project's commit history. This capability is essential for maintaining a clean, meaningful commit history that tells a clear story of your project's development.

## What is History Rewriting?

History rewriting involves changing commits that have already been made. This can include:
- Modifying commit messages
- Combining multiple commits into one
- Splitting a single commit into multiple commits
- Removing commits entirely
- Reordering commits
- Editing the content of commits

## Why Rewrite History?

### Clean Project History
- Remove experimental or debugging commits
- Fix typos in commit messages
- Combine related changes into logical commits
- Remove sensitive information accidentally committed

### Better Collaboration
- Present a clear, logical progression of changes
- Make code reviews more effective
- Simplify troubleshooting and debugging
- Create meaningful release notes

### Professional Standards
- Maintain consistent commit message formats
- Follow team conventions and standards
- Prepare clean feature branches for merging

## Common History Rewriting Tools

### Interactive Rebase (`git rebase -i`)
The most powerful tool for history rewriting, allowing you to:
- Edit commit messages
- Reorder commits
- Squash commits together
- Split commits
- Remove commits

### Amend (`git commit --amend`)
Quick way to modify the most recent commit:
- Change the commit message
- Add forgotten files
- Remove files that shouldn't be included

### Filter Branch (`git filter-branch`)
Advanced tool for rewriting entire repository history:
- Remove files from all commits
- Change author information
- Modify directory structure

### Cherry Pick (`git cherry-pick`)
Apply specific commits from other branches:
- Selectively apply bug fixes
- Port features between branches
- Recover commits from deleted branches

## Important Warnings

### Never Rewrite Public History
- Only rewrite commits that haven't been pushed to shared repositories
- Rewriting published history can break other developers' work
- Use `git push --force` with extreme caution

### Backup Before Rewriting
- Create backup branches before major history changes
- Use `git reflog` to recover lost commits
- Test changes in a separate repository first

### Team Communication
- Coordinate with team members before rewriting shared history
- Establish team policies for history rewriting
- Document any necessary force pushes

## Best Practices

1. **Work on Feature Branches**: Rewrite history on feature branches before merging
2. **Atomic Commits**: Each commit should represent a single logical change
3. **Meaningful Messages**: Write clear, descriptive commit messages
4. **Regular Cleanup**: Clean up history regularly, not just before releases
5. **Review Changes**: Always review rewritten history before pushing

## When NOT to Rewrite History

- On the main/master branch of shared repositories
- After commits have been merged into main branches
- When working on public/open-source projects without maintainer permissions
- If you're unsure about the impact on team members
