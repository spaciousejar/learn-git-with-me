# Git Bisect

Git Bisect is an interactive tool used to identify which commit in your project's history introduced a bug or regression. You start by identifying two commits: one where the issue isn't present (the "good" commit) and another where it is (the "bad" commit). Then, run `git bisect start`, followed by `git bisect good` for the good commit and `git bisect bad` for the bad commit. Git Bisect will guide you through a binary search process, asking you to test the midpoint of your current range until it identifies the exact commit that introduced the bug or regression.
