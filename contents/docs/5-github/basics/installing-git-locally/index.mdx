# Installing Git Locally

To use Git on your local machine, you need to install it first. The installation process varies depending on your operating system:

- On Windows: Download the binary from the official Git or GitHub release page and follow the installation instructions.
- On macOS (using Homebrew): Run `brew install git` in your terminal.
- On Linux: Run `sudo apt-get install git` or `sudo yum install git` depending on your distribution.

Once installed, you can verify the Git version by running `git --version` in your terminal. This will display the currently installed Git version.
