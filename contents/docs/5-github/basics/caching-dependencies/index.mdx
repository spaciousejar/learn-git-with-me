# Caching Dependencies

GitHub Actions provides a caching feature that allows you to store and reuse dependencies between workflows, reducing the time it takes to run your actions. By caching dependencies, you can:

- Reuse compiled code
- Store database connections
- Reduce network traffic

It is highly recommended to not store any sensitive information in the cache. For example, sensitive information can include access tokens or login credentials stored in a file in the cache path.
