# Teams within Organization

GitHub Organizations allow you to create teams within your organization, which helps in organizing members based on their roles and responsibilities.

- Grouping: Team members can be grouped together according to the company or group's structure.
- Access permissions: Access permissions can be cascaded from one team member to another.
- Mentions: Team mentions allow for easy referencing of specific teams in repository discussions.
