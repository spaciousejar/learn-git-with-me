# GitHub Security

GitHub Security is a suite of features and tools that help developers identify, fix, and prevent security vulnerabilities in their code. It provides a comprehensive approach to secure coding practices by integrating with the developer's workflow. The main components of GitHub Security include: `Code Scanning`, which uses AI-powered analysis to detect potential vulnerabilities; `Dependabot`, which automates dependency updates to prevent attacks via vulnerable dependencies; `Secret scanning`, which detects and flags secrets like API keys or credentials; and `GitHub Advanced Security`, which offers more advanced security features for larger teams. By using these tools, developers can ensure their code is secure, and identify potential issues before they become serious problems.
