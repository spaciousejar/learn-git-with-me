# Repository Collaborators

Collaborators are users who have been granted specific access to a repository. They can contribute code, manage issues, and perform various actions based on their permission level.

## Types of Repository Access

GitHub provides different levels of access for collaborators:

## Adding Collaborators

<Steps>
1. **Navigate to repository**: Go to your GitHub repository
2. **Access settings**: Click the "Settings" tab
3. **Manage access**: Click "Manage access" in the left sidebar
4. **Invite collaborator**: Click "Invite a collaborator"
5. **Enter username**: Type the GitHub username or email
6. **Set permissions**: Choose the appropriate access level
7. **Send invitation**: Click "Add [username] to this repository"
</Steps>

## Best Practices for Managing Collaborators

### Permission Management
- **Principle of least privilege**: Give users only the access they need
- **Regular reviews**: Periodically review and update collaborator permissions
- **Remove inactive users**: Remove collaborators who no longer need access

### Team Organization
- **Use organizations**: For larger projects, use GitHub Organizations
- **Create teams**: Group collaborators with similar roles
- **Document roles**: Clearly define what each permission level means for your project

<Aside type="caution">
Admin permissions should be granted sparingly as they include the ability to delete the repository and manage sensitive settings.

## Working with External Collaborators

### Fork and Pull Model
For open source projects or when working with external contributors:

1. Contributors fork your repository
2. They make changes in their fork
3. They submit a pull request
4. You review and merge their changes

### Direct Collaboration
For trusted team members:

1. Add them as collaborators
2. They can work directly on branches
3. Use pull requests for code review
4. Maintain branch protection rules

## Collaboration Tools

### Branch Protection Rules
- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks
- Restrict who can push to protected branches
- Require signed commits

### Code Review Process
- Use pull request templates
- Establish review requirements
- Set up automated checks
- Document review guidelines
