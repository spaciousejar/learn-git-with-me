Project planning on GitHub is a comprehensive process that leverages the platform's built-in tools to organize, track, and manage software development projects efficiently. It typically involves using features such as Issues for task tracking, Projects for kanban-style boards, Milestones for grouping related issues and pull requests, and Labels for categorization. These tools, combined with GitHub's collaborative features like pull requests and code reviews, enable teams to create structured workflows, set priorities, assign tasks, and monitor progress throughout the development lifecycle. By centralizing project management within the same platform used for version control, GitHub streamlines communication and enhances productivity for development teams of all sizes.
