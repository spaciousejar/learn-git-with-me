# Documentation

A well-maintained repository should include documentation that helps others understand the project, its context, and how to contribute to it. This is essential for fostering a community around your project and making it easier for newcomers to join in.

Here are some key sections of documentation that you should consider including in each repository:

- README.md: A brief introduction to the project, explaining what it's about, why it exists, and how to get started.
- CONTRIBUTING.md: Guidelines on how others can contribute to the project, including steps for reporting issues, submitting pull requests, or suggesting new features.
- LICENSE: Information about the license under which the repository is released, ensuring users understand their rights and responsibilities when using your code.
- CHANGELOG: A history of changes made to the project over time, highlighting significant updates, bug fixes, or feature additions.

These documents help ensure a smooth onboarding process for contributors, making it easier for them to collaborate effectively and enhance the overall project.
