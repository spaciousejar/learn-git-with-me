A GitHub Gist is a small code or text snippet that can be shared with others. It is a simple way to share code, configuration files, or other snippets of text without creating a full-fledged repository. Gists are useful for sharing examples, demos, or tutorials, and they can also serve as a starting point for larger projects. Each gist has a unique URL that can be shared with others, allowing them to view and edit the content. Gists support various file types, including code files, text files, and even images. They also provide features like syntax highlighting, line numbers, and commit history.
