# GitHub Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces is a cloud-based development environment that allows developers to create, access, and use pre-configured, ready-to-use environments for coding. It provides a seamless way to develop, test, and debug applications in a virtual machine or container, eliminating the need for local setup and configuration. With GitHub Codespaces, users can spin up a new environment with their desired configuration, tools, and dependencies in just a few clicks. This feature streamlines development workflows, reduces friction, and increases productivity by providing instant access to a tailored coding environment for each project.
