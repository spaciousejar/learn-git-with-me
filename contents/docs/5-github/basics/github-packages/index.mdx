# GitHub Packages

GitHub Packages is a package repository service that allows developers to store and share packages, containers, and other software artifacts. It provides a central location for sharing packages with teams, organizations, or the wider developer community. GitHub Packages supports popular package managers like npm, Maven, and Gradle, as well as container registries like Docker Hub. This feature enables seamless integration of packages into development workflows, making it easier to share dependencies, libraries, and frameworks within and across projects. By using GitHub Packages, developers can simplify dependency management, reduce errors, and improve overall collaboration.
