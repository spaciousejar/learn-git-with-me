# .gitignore

Ignored files are tracked in a special file named `.gitignore` that is checked in at the root of your repository. There is no explicit git ignore command: instead the `.gitignore` file must be edited and committed by hand when you have new files that you wish to ignore. `.gitignore` files contain patterns that are matched against file names in your repository to determine whether or not they should be ignored.
