# Storing Artifacts

GitHub provides a feature for storing artifacts, which allows you to upload build outputs or other files as part of your workflow.

- Artifacts: These are files generated by a job, such as compiled binaries, test reports, or logs. They can be used to validate the results of a build or deployment.
- Referenceable storage: Artifacts are stored in a referenceable way, making it easy to access and use them in future builds.
