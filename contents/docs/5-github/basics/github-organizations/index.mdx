# GitHub Organizations

GitHub Organizations are shared accounts that provide centralized management and collaboration for multiple projects and teams. They offer enhanced administrative controls, allowing owners to create teams with specific access permissions, manage member roles, and oversee repositories at scale. Organizations facilitate better project coordination, resource sharing, and team communication, making them ideal for businesses, open-source projects, and large-scale collaborations. With features like team discussions, project boards, and audit logs, GitHub Organizations streamline workflow management and foster a more structured and secure development environment.
