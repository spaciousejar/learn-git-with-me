# GitHub Reactions

GitHub reactions are a quick way to express how you feel about comments, issues, pull requests, and discussions without having to write a full comment. They help reduce noise while still allowing you to show support or express feelings about content.

## Available Reactions

GitHub provides several reaction types:

- 👍 **Thumbs up** - Express agreement or approval
- 👎 **Thumbs down** - Express disagreement or disapproval  
- 😄 **Laugh** - Something is funny
- 😕 **Confused** - Something is unclear
- ❤️ **Heart** - Show love or appreciation
- 🎉 **Hooray** - Celebrate success
- 👀 **Eyes** - Indicate you're watching or interested
