# Project Roadmaps

Roadmaps help communicate the planned direction and timeline for your project.

## Creating Roadmaps

GitHub doesn't have built-in roadmap functionality, but you can create them using:

- **GitHub Projects**: Use timeline or roadmap views
- **Issues and Milestones**: Organize by release dates
- **README files**: Document high-level plans
- **Discussions**: Gather community input

## Best Practices

- **Keep it high-level**: Focus on major features and releases
- **Be flexible**: Plans change, roadmaps should too
- **Communicate clearly**: Use simple, understandable language
- **Update regularly**: Keep roadmaps current
