  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Code Security">
    - **Code Scanning**: Static analysis to find security issues
    - **Secret Scanning**: Detection of leaked secrets
    - **Security Advisories**: Create and publish security advisories
    - **Security Policies**: Define security reporting guidelines
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Access Control">
    - **Branch Protection**: Enforce code review and status checks
    - **Two-factor authentication**: Enhanced login security

    - **Security Keys**: Support for physical security keys
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Setting Up GitHub Security Features

### Dependency Security

<Steps>
  1. Enable the Dependency Graph (enabled by default for public repositories)
      - For private repositories: Repository Settings > Security & analysis > Enable Dependency graph
      
  2. Enable Dependabot alerts
      - Go to Repository Settings > Security & analysis
      - Click "Enable" next to Dependabot alerts
      
  3. Configure Dependabot security updates
      - Go to Repository Settings > Security & analysis
      - Click "Enable" next to Dependabot security updates
      
  4. For more control, create a `dependabot.yml` file in `.github` directory:
  
     ```yaml
     version: 2
     updates:
       - package-ecosystem: "npm"
         directory: "/"
         schedule:
           interval: "weekly"
         open-pull-requests-limit: 10
     ```
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  You can configure different update schedules for different package ecosystems in the same repository, allowing for ecosystem-specific update strategies.
</Aside>

### Code Scanning with CodeQL

<Steps>
  1. Go to your repository's Security tab
  2. Select "Code scanning" from the menu
  3. Click "Set up code scanning"
  4. Choose "CodeQL Analysis"
  5. Commit the workflow file to your repository
</Steps>

Example CodeQL workflow:

```yaml
name: "CodeQL"

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'

jobs:
  analyze:
    name: Analyze
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      actions: read
      contents: read
      security-events: write

    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        language: [ 'javascript', 'python' ]

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Initialize CodeQL
      uses: github/codeql-action/init@v2
      with:
        languages: ${{ matrix.language }}

    - name: Autobuild
      uses: github/codeql-action/autobuild@v2

    - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
      uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
```

### Secret Scanning

GitHub automatically scans public repositories for known secret formats. For private repositories:

<Steps>
  1. Go to Repository Settings > Security & analysis
  2. Click "Enable" next to Secret scanning
</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">
  If a secret is detected, GitHub notifies the service provider who issued the secret. They can then revoke the compromised secret, issue a new one, or contact you directly.
</Aside>

## Creating a Security Policy

A security policy helps others know how to report security vulnerabilities:

<Steps>
  1. Go to your repository's Security tab
  2. Click "Security policy"
  3. Click "Start setup"
  4. Edit the SECURITY.md template
  5. Commit the file to your repository
</Steps>

Example security policy:

```markdown
# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

These versions are currently supported with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.0.x   | :x:                |
| 4.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 4.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability:

1. Go to the Security tab of this repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the form with details about the vulnerability

We will respond within 48 hours and keep you updated on our progress.
```

## Security Best Practices for GitHub Repositories

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Branch Protection">
    Configure branch protection rules:
    
    1. Go to repository Settings > Branches
    2. Click "Add rule" next to Branch protection rules
    3. Configure these recommended settings:
       - Require pull request reviews before merging
       - Require status checks to pass before merging
       - Require signed commits
       - Include administrators
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Access Control">
    - Regularly audit repository access
    - Follow the principle of least privilege
    - Use fine-grained personal access tokens
    - Enable two-factor authentication for all contributors
    - Review and prune inactive collaborators
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Secure Development">
    - Use a `.gitignore` file to prevent committing sensitive files
    - Store secrets in GitHub Secrets, not in code
    - Include security testing in CI/CD pipelines
    - Review dependency license compliance
    - Implement codeowners to enforce reviews by security experts
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Security Advisories

When you discover a vulnerability in your project:

<Steps>
  1. Go to the Security tab of your repository
  2. Click "Advisories"
  3. Click "New draft security advisory"
  4. Fill in details about the vulnerability
  5. Work privately to fix the issue
  6. Publish the advisory when ready
</Steps>

<Aside type="note">
  Creating a security advisory automatically creates a temporary private fork where you can collaborate on fixing the vulnerability before disclosure.
</Aside>
