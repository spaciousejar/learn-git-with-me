GitHub Projects is a flexible project management tool that integrates directly with your GitHub issues and pull requests. It allows teams to plan, track, and manage their work efficiently while maintaining a close connection to their code repositories.

## Understanding GitHub Projects

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Projects (Classic)">
    The original project board implementation:
    
    - Simple kanban-style boards
    - Basic automation for card movement
    - Limited customization options
    - Repository or organization level
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Projects (New)">
    The newer, more powerful implementation:
    
    - Spreadsheet and board views
    - Custom fields for detailed tracking
    - More advanced filtering and sorting
    - Powerful automations and workflows
    - Enhanced integration with GitHub issues
    - Saved views for different perspectives
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Setting Up GitHub Projects

<Steps>
  1. Navigate to your profile, repository, or organization
  2. Go to the "Projects" tab
  3. Click "New project"
  4. Select a template or start from scratch
  5. Give your project a name and description
  6. Customize views, fields, and workflows
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  For team collaboration, organization-level projects are recommended as they can span multiple repositories and provide centralized tracking.

## Key Features of GitHub Projects

### Views

GitHub Projects offers multiple ways to visualize your work:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Table View">
    - Spreadsheet-like interface
    - See all fields at once
    - Sort and group items
    - Perform bulk actions
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Board View">
    - Kanban-style workflow visualization
    - Drag and drop card management
    - Group by any field (status, assignee, etc.)
    - Visual progress tracking
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Roadmap View">
    - Timeline visualization
    - Date-based planning
    - View work across time periods
    - Identify dependencies and overlaps
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Custom Fields

Enhance your tracking capabilities with custom fields:

- **Text fields**: Add context and details
- **Number fields**: Track metrics, story points, etc.
- **Date fields**: Set deadlines and milestones
- **Single select fields**: Create custom statuses or categories
- **Iteration fields**: Group work into sprints
- **Labels**: Categorize and tag items

### Workflows and Automation

Streamline project management with automated workflows:

```yaml
# Example workflow
name: Add issues to project

on:
  issues:
    types:
      - opened

jobs:
  add-to-project:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/add-to-project@v0.4.0
        with:
          project-url: https://github.com/users/username/projects/1
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

<Aside type="note">
  Built-in workflow rules can automatically update fields, move items between statuses, or apply labels based on events without requiring GitHub Actions.
</Aside>

## Project Management Best Practices

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Agile/Scrum">
    - Use iteration fields for sprints
    - Set up statuses for "Backlog", "In Progress", "Review", and "Done"
    - Use number fields for story points
    - Create views filtered by current sprint
    - Group by assignee to see workload distribution
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Kanban">
    - Focus on board view with status columns
    - Limit work in progress (WIP)
    - Create automations for card movement
    - Use labels for prioritization
    - Add note items for process policies
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Feature Planning">
    - Group issues by feature or epic
    - Use roadmap view to plan release timelines
    - Create custom fields for feature status
    - Track dependencies between features
    - Link to design documents or specifications
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Integration with GitHub Issues and PRs

GitHub Projects provides seamless integration with issues and pull requests:

- Issues and PRs can be added to projects directly
- Status updates in projects can reflect in repositories
- Converting project items to issues
- Tracking PR status within project boards
- Automatically closing items when PRs are merged

<Aside type="caution">
  When deleting items from a project, the linked issues and PRs are not affected. However, deleting an issue or PR will remove it from all projects it's part of.
</Aside>

## Project Insights and Reporting

Track progress and generate insights from your projects:

1. Use the built-in charts for burndown analysis
2. Create custom views for reporting
3. Export project data for external reporting
4. Track velocity with iteration fields
5. Visualize work distribution across team members
