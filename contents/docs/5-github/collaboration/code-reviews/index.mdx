# Code Reviews on GitHub

Code reviews are a critical part of collaborative development, helping maintain code quality, share knowledge, and catch bugs before they reach production.

## What is a Code Review?

A code review is the process of examining code changes before they are merged into the main codebase. On GitHub, this happens through Pull Requests (PRs).

## Benefits of Code Reviews

- **Quality assurance**: Catch bugs and issues early
- **Knowledge sharing**: Team members learn from each other
- **Code consistency**: Maintain coding standards across the team
- **Documentation**: PRs serve as a record of why changes were made
- **Security**: Identify potential security vulnerabilities

## How to Conduct a Code Review

<Steps>
1. **Understand the context**: Read the PR description and related issues
2. **Review the changes**: Look at the diff and understand what changed
3. **Test the changes**: Pull the branch locally if needed
4. **Provide feedback**: Leave comments on specific lines
5. **Make a decision**: Approve, request changes, or comment
6. **Follow up**: Ensure feedback is addressed
</Steps>

## Best Practices for Reviewers

### What to Look For
- **Correctness**: Does the code do what it's supposed to do?
- **Clarity**: Is the code easy to understand?
- **Performance**: Are there any performance issues?
- **Security**: Are there any security vulnerabilities?
- **Testing**: Are there adequate tests?
- **Documentation**: Is the code properly documented?

### How to Give Feedback
- **Be specific**: Point to exact lines that need attention
- **Be constructive**: Suggest improvements, not just problems
- **Ask questions**: Use questions to understand intent
- **Praise good work**: Acknowledge well-written code
- **Focus on the code**: Review the code, not the coder

## Best Practices for Authors

### Before Requesting Review
- **Self-review first**: Review your own changes before submitting
- **Write clear descriptions**: Explain what changes were made and why
- **Keep PRs focused**: Make one logical change per PR
- **Add tests**: Include appropriate test coverage
- **Update documentation**: Update docs if needed

### During Review
- **Respond promptly**: Address feedback in a timely manner
- **Ask for clarification**: If feedback is unclear, ask questions
- **Be open to feedback**: Consider suggestions objectively
- **Explain decisions**: If you disagree with feedback, explain why

## Review Types on GitHub

### Approval States
- **Approve**: The changes look good and can be merged
- **Request Changes**: The PR needs modifications before merging
- **Comment**: Provide feedback without explicit approval/rejection

### Review Tools
- **Line comments**: Comment on specific lines of code
- **General comments**: Overall feedback on the PR
- **Suggestions**: Propose specific code changes
- **File comments**: Comments that apply to entire files

## Setting Up Review Requirements

You can configure repositories to require reviews:

1. Go to repository Settings
2. Navigate to Branches
3. Add a branch protection rule
4. Require pull request reviews before merging
5. Set the number of required reviewers

## Common Code Review Patterns

### The Nitpick
Focus on style and minor issues. Use sparingly and consider automation instead.

### The Teaching Moment
Use reviews to share knowledge and explain better approaches.

### The Safety Check
Focus on security, performance, and correctness issues.

### The Architecture Review
Discuss design decisions and architectural patterns.
