# Creating Pull Requests from Forks

Contributing to open-source projects often involves forking a repository and submitting changes through pull requests. This workflow is foundational to collaborative development on GitHub and enables contributions without direct write access to the original repository.

## The Fork and PR Workflow

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Overview">
    - **Fork**: Create a personal copy of someone else's project
    - **Clone**: Download your fork to your local machine
    - **Branch**: Create a new branch for your changes
    - **Commit**: Make and commit your changes
    - **Push**: Upload your changes to your fork
    - **Pull Request**: Propose your changes to the original project
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Benefits">
    - Allows contributions without direct repository access
    - Provides isolated environment to experiment
    - Enables project maintainers to review changes before merging
    - Creates a permanent record of contribution discussions
    - Helps maintain quality control for projects
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Creating a Pull Request from a Fork

<Steps>
  1. Fork the repository by clicking the "Fork" button in the top-right of the repository page
  2. Clone your fork to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
     ```
  3. Set up the original repository as an "upstream" remote:
     ```bash
     git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL-OWNER/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
     ```
  4. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature-branch-name
     ```
  5. Make your changes and commit them with descriptive messages
  6. Push your branch to your fork:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature-branch-name
     ```
  7. Navigate to the original repository on GitHub
  8. Click the "New pull request" button
  9. Click "compare across forks" and select your fork and branch
  10. Fill in the PR description and submit
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  Keeping your fork synchronized with the upstream repository is important. Regularly fetch and merge changes to avoid conflicts:
  ```bash
  git fetch upstream
  git checkout main
  git merge upstream/main
  ```
</Aside>

## Common Challenges and Solutions

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Keeping Forks Updated">
    To avoid out-of-date forks and potential merge conflicts:
    
    ```bash
    # Update your local copy of the upstream repository
    git fetch upstream
    
    # Checkout your main branch
    git checkout main
    
    # Merge upstream changes
    git merge upstream/main
    
    # Push changes to your fork
    git push origin main
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Handling PR Feedback">
    When reviewers request changes:
    
    1. Make the requested changes in your local branch
    2. Commit the changes
    3. Push to your fork
    4. The PR will automatically update
    
    Use `git commit --amend` and `git push --force-with-lease` to clean up commits before final review, but only if you understand the implications.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## PR Etiquette for Forked Repositories

- **Read Contribution Guidelines**: Most projects have a CONTRIBUTING.md file with specific requirements
- **One Feature Per PR**: Keep pull requests focused on a single change
- **Be Responsive**: Respond promptly to feedback and questions
- **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure your changes work as expected
- **Write Clear Descriptions**: Explain what your changes do and why they're needed
- **Be Patient**: Maintainers may be busy; wait for feedback

<Aside type="caution">
  Never force-push to a branch that already has an open PR unless specifically requested by the maintainers, as it makes reviewing changes difficult.
</Aside>
