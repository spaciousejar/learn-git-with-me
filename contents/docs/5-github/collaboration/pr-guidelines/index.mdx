# Pull Request Guidelines

Pull Requests (PRs) are essential for collaborative development on GitHub. Well-structured PR guidelines help maintain code quality, improve review efficiency, and ensure smooth project collaboration.

## Effective PR Guidelines

Establishing clear PR guidelines for your repository helps contributors understand expectations and streamlines the review process.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="PR Template Components">
    - **Purpose/Description**: What does this PR accomplish?
    - **Issue Reference**: Link to related issues
    - **Changes Overview**: Summary of key changes
    - **Testing Details**: How the changes were tested
    - **Screenshots/Videos**: Visual evidence (if applicable)
    - **Checklist**: Standards that should be met
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Review Process">
    - Define how many reviewers are required
    - Set expectations for review response time
    - Outline criteria for approving PRs
    - Explain how to request changes effectively
    - Document required status checks or tests
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Creating PR Templates

A PR template ensures contributors provide all necessary information to reviewers.

<Steps>
  1. Create a `.github` directory in your repository's root
  2. Create a `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` file inside this directory
  3. Add your desired template content following markdown syntax
  4. Commit and push the template to your repository
</Steps>

Here's a sample PR template:

```markdown
## Description
<!-- Provide a brief description of the changes in this PR -->

## Related Issue
<!-- Link to the issue this PR resolves -->
Fixes #(issue)

## Type of change
- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Documentation update
- [ ] Code refactoring
- [ ] Other (please describe):

## How Has This Been Tested?
<!-- Describe the tests you ran -->

## Screenshots (if applicable)
<!-- Add screenshots to help explain your changes -->

## Checklist
- [ ] My code follows the style guidelines of this project
- [ ] I have performed a self-review of my code
- [ ] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas
- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation
- [ ] My changes generate no new warnings
- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works
```

<Aside type="caution">
  Templates should be comprehensive but not overwhelming. Focus on information that truly helps reviewers understand and evaluate the changes.
</Aside>

## PR Size Best Practices

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Keep PRs Small">
    - Aim for less than 500 lines of changes when possible
    - Focus on a single logical change per PR
    - Break large features into smaller, sequential PRs
    - Consider using feature flags for incomplete functionality
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Provide Context">
    - Explain the reasoning behind implementation choices
    - Link to design documents or discussions
    - Highlight areas that may need special attention
    - Provide context for non-obvious changes
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
