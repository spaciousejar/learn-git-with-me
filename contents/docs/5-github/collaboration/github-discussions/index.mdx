GitHub Discussions provides a collaborative communication space for your community outside of your codebase. This feature allows project maintainers, contributors, and users to gather and have conversations about a project without tying them to specific issues or pull requests.

## What are GitHub Discussions?

GitHub Discussions are dedicated spaces for open-ended conversations related to your project. Unlike issues (which typically focus on specific bugs or features) or pull requests (which focus on code changes), Discussions provide a forum-like experience for:

- General questions and answers
- Sharing ideas and announcements
- Community conversation and collaboration
- Documentation and knowledge sharing

- **Show and Tell**: Community sharing their projects
- **General**: Miscellaneous conversations

  The Q&A category has special functionality that allows marking answers as "solutions," making it easier for others to find answers to common questions.
