# Collaboration on GitHub

    - Automation through workflows
    - Integration with issues and PRs
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Effective GitHub Collaboration Workflow

<Steps>
  1. **Create an Issue**: Document the task, bug, or feature request
  2. **Discuss the approach**: Use comments to align on implementation
  3. **Create a branch**: Make a dedicated branch for the work
  4. **Implement changes**: Make commits on your branch
  5. **Create a Pull Request**: Reference the issue in your PR
  6. **Code Review**: Collaborate on improving the code
  7. **Address feedback**: Make requested changes
  8. **Merge**: Incorporate the changes into the main branch
  9. **Close the issue**: Mark the task as complete
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  Use GitHub's "Fixes #123" or "Closes #123" syntax in PR descriptions or commit messages to automatically close referenced issues when the PR is merged.
</Aside>

## Collaboration Access Management

GitHub provides granular permission controls to manage who can do what in your repository:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Repository Roles">
    - **Read**: View and clone the repository
    - **Triage**: Manage issues and PRs without write access
    - **Write**: Push to the repository and manage issues/PRs
    - **Maintain**: Manage repository without access to sensitive actions
    - **Admin**: Full control including sensitive actions
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Branch Protection">
    Critical settings for collaborative repositories:
    
    - Require pull request reviews before merging
    - Require status checks to pass
    - Require signed commits
    - Restrict who can push to matching branches
    - Enable force push restrictions
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Effective Code Review Practices on GitHub

Code reviews are essential to maintaining quality and sharing knowledge:

1. **Be specific**: Point to exact lines that need attention
2. **Be constructive**: Suggest improvements, not just point out problems
3. **Ask questions**: Use questions to understand intent rather than making assumptions
4. **Praise good work**: Acknowledge well-written or clever code
5. **Focus on the code**: Review the code, not the coder
6. **Be timely**: Respond to review requests promptly

<Aside type="caution">
  Remember that GitHub comments support Markdown formatting, including code blocks, which makes it easier to suggest specific changes:
  
  ```javascript
  function betterImplementation() {
    // Your suggested code
  }
  ```
</Aside>

## Collaboration Etiquette on GitHub

- **Be respectful**: Maintain professionalism in all interactions
- **Stay focused**: Keep comments relevant to the task at hand
- **Follow the templates**: Use issue and PR templates if provided
- **Document decisions**: Record important decisions in issues or PRs
- **Update outdated discussions**: Link newer discussions to older ones
- **Engage constructively**: Participate in discussions with a problem-solving mindset
