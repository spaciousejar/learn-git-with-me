title: Pull Requests
---

Pull requests (PRs) are a core feature of GitHub that allow you to propose changes to a repository and collaborate with others through code review.

## What are Pull Requests?

Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository. Once opened, you can discuss and review potential changes with collaborators before merging them into the base branch.

## Creating a Pull Request

### From Your Branch
```bash
# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# Push branch to GitHub
git push origin feature/new-feature
```

### Open PR on GitHub
1. **Navigate to repository** on GitHub
2. **Click "Compare & pull request"** (appears after pushing)
3. **Choose base and compare branches**
4. **Add title and description**
5. **Request reviewers** (optional)
6. **Add labels and assignees** (optional)
7. **Create pull request**

### PR Metadata
- **Assignees**: Who's responsible for the PR
- **Reviewers**: Who should review the code
- **Labels**: Categorize the PR (bug, feature, etc.)
- **Milestones**: Associate with project milestones
- **Projects**: Link to project boards

## Review Process

### Requesting Reviews
```bash
# In PR description, mention reviewers
@username please review this PR

# Use GitHub's reviewer assignment
# Select reviewers from dropdown
```

### Review Types
- **Comment**: General feedback without approval
- **Approve**: Accept the changes
- **Request changes**: Require modifications before merge

### Review Features
- **Line comments**: Comment on specific lines
- **Suggestion**: Propose code changes
- **Batch comments**: Submit multiple comments together
- **Resolve conversations**: Mark discussions as resolved

## PR Workflow

### Standard Workflow
```
1. Create feature branch
   ├── Make changes
   ├── Commit changes
   └── Push to GitHub

2. Open pull request
   ├── Add description
   ├── Request reviewers
   └── Add metadata

3. Code review
   ├── Address feedback
   ├── Make additional commits
   └── Resolve conversations

4. Merge pull request
   ├── Squash and merge (recommended)
   ├── Merge commit
   └── Rebase and merge
```

## Merge Options

### Squash and Merge
```bash
# Combines all commits into single commit
# Keeps clean history
# Default option for most teams
```

### Merge Commit
```bash
# Preserves individual commits
# Creates merge commit
# Shows branch history
```

### Rebase and Merge
```bash
# Applies commits individually
# No merge commit
# Linear history
```

## PR Best Practices

### Good PR Guidelines
- **Small, focused changes**: Easier to review
- **Clear descriptions**: Explain what and why
- **Link to issues**: Reference related issues
- **Test thoroughly**: Ensure changes work
- **Update documentation**: Keep docs current

### PR Description Template
```markdown
## Summary
Brief description of changes

## Changes Made
- [ ] Added feature X
- [ ] Fixed bug Y
- [ ] Updated documentation

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing completed

## Screenshots (if applicable)
[Add screenshots for UI changes]

## Checklist
- [ ] Code follows style guidelines
- [ ] Self-review completed

Closes #issue-number
```

## Managing PRs

### Draft Pull Requests
```bash
# Create draft PR for work in progress
# Mark as "ready for review" when complete
# Useful for early feedback
```

### Converting to Draft
1. Click "Convert to draft" in PR sidebar
2. Make additional changes
3. Mark "Ready for review" when complete

### Closing PRs
```bash
# Close without merging
# Useful for abandoned features
# Can be reopened later if needed
```

## Automated Checks

### Status Checks
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Automated testing
- **Code quality**: Linting, formatting
- **Security scans**: Vulnerability detection
- **Coverage reports**: Test coverage metrics

### Branch Protection
```bash
# Require status checks to pass
# Require reviews before merge
# Restrict who can merge
# Require up-to-date branches
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Merge Conflicts
```bash
# Update your branch with main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature-branch
git merge main

# Resolve conflicts and push
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
git push origin feature-branch
```

#### Failed Checks
```bash
# Check CI/CD logs
# Fix failing tests
# Address linting issues
# Push fixes to same branch
```

## Advanced Features
