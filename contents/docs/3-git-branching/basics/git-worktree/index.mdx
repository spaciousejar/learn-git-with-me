# Git Worktree

A Git worktree allows you to create multiple working directories for a single repository, each with its own checkout and index. Unlike a regular checkout, which creates a new working directory for a specific branch and updates your IDE's configuration settings, a Git worktree does not require you to switch between branches using git checkout. This means you can have multiple branches checked out at the same time without affecting each other or requiring changes to your IDE configurations. By creating a separate worktree for each branch, you can stage changes independently and maintain distinct working directories without impacting the main repository or its working directory.
