title: Branching Basics
description: Branches in Git serve as separate lines of development that allow multiple features or changes to be worked on simultaneously without affecting the main codebase. With branches, you can create isolated environments for different tasks, collaborate with others, and manage complex workflows.

## What are Git Branches?

Think of Git branches as **parallel universes** for your code. Each branch represents a separate line of development where you can make changes without affecting other branches. This is like having multiple drafts of a document where you can experiment with different ideas simultaneously.

### Why Use Branches?

1. **Isolation**: Work on features without breaking the main code
2. **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different features simultaneously
3. **Experimentation**: Try new ideas without risk
4. **Organization**: Keep different types of work separated

## Visual Understanding

Here's how branches work conceptually:

```
Initial Repository:
main: A---B---C

After Creating a Feature Branch:
main:    A---B---C
         ↘
feature:   D---E

After More Development:
main:    A---B---C---F
         ↘         ↗
feature:   D---E---G
```

## Common Branching Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Feature Development

**Situation**: You need to add a new login system to your website.

**Step-by-Step Process**:

1. **Start from main branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main  # Get latest changes
   ```

2. **Create and switch to feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/login-system
   ```

3. **Work on your feature**:
   ```bash
   # Make changes to files
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add login form HTML structure"
   git commit -m "Add login validation logic"
   git commit -m "Add login styling"
   ```

4. **Push your branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/login-system
   ```

**Expected Outcome**: You now have a separate branch with your login feature that doesn't interfere with the main codebase.

### Scenario 2: Bug Fix

**Situation**: There's a critical bug in production that needs immediate fixing.

**Step-by-Step Process**:

1. **Create hotfix branch from main**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git checkout -b hotfix/fix-payment-error
   ```

2. **Fix the bug**:
   ```bash
   # Fix the payment processing issue
   git add src/payment.js
   git commit -m "Fix null pointer exception in payment processing"
   ```

3. **Push and deploy quickly**:
   ```bash
   git push origin hotfix/fix-payment-error
   # Create pull request for review and merge
   ```

**Expected Outcome**: Bug is fixed in isolation and can be quickly merged back to main.

## Branch States and Visualization

### Before Creating Branch
```
Repository State:
main: [A] ← [B] ← [C] ← HEAD

Working Directory: Clean
Current Branch: main
```

### After Creating Feature Branch
```
Repository State:
main:    [A] ← [B] ← [C]
                     ↑
feature: [A] ← [B] ← [C] ← HEAD

Working Directory: Clean
Current Branch: feature
```

### After Making Changes on Feature Branch
```
Repository State:
main:    [A] ← [B] ← [C]
                     ↑
feature: [A] ← [B] ← [C] ← [D] ← [E] ← HEAD

Working Directory: Clean
Current Branch: feature
```

## Best Practices for Beginners

### 1. Always Start from Updated Main
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b your-new-branch
```

### 2. Use Descriptive Branch Names
- ✅ Good: `feature/user-authentication`
- ✅ Good: `bugfix/payment-validation`
- ✅ Good: `hotfix/security-patch`
- ❌ Bad: `my-branch`
- ❌ Bad: `temp`
- ❌ Bad: `new-stuff`

### 3. Keep Branches Focused
- One branch = One feature or fix
- Avoid mixing unrelated changes
- Smaller branches are easier to review and merge

### 4. Regular Commits with Clear Messages
```bash
git commit -m "Add user input validation"
git commit -m "Implement password encryption"
git commit -m "Add error handling for failed login"
```

## Common Beginner Mistakes and Solutions

### Mistake 1: Working Directly on Main
**Problem**: Making changes directly on the main branch
**Solution**: Always create a new branch for any work
```bash
# Instead of working on main, do this:
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
```

### Mistake 2: Forgetting to Switch Branches
**Problem**: Making commits on the wrong branch
**Solution**: Always check your current branch
```bash
git branch  # Shows current branch with *
git status  # Shows current branch in output
```

### Mistake 3: Not Updating Main Before Branching
**Problem**: Creating branches from outdated main
**Solution**: Always pull latest changes first
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b new-feature
```

## Real-World Example: E-commerce Website

Let's say you're working on an e-commerce website. Here's how different team members might use branches:

```
main:     [v1.0] ← [v1.1] ← [v1.2]
              ↘         ↘         ↘
feature/cart:   [add-item] ← [remove-item]
feature/search:       [search-bar] ← [filters]
hotfix/checkout:                    [fix-payment]
```

**Alice** works on the shopping cart feature:
- Branch: `feature/shopping-cart`
- Commits: Add items, remove items, calculate totals

**Bob** works on search functionality:
- Branch: `feature/product-search`  
- Commits: Search bar, filters, sorting

**Carol** fixes a payment bug:
- Branch: `hotfix/payment-processing`
- Commits: Quick fix for critical payment issue

Each person works independently without interfering with others' work.
