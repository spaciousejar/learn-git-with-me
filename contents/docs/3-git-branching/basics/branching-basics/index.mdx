![Branching Workflow](/images/docs/3-git-branching/branching-workflow.svg)

Branches in Git serve as separate lines of development that allow multiple features or changes to be worked on simultaneously without affecting the main codebase. With branches, you can create isolated environments for different tasks, collaborate with others, and manage complex workflows.

## Why Use Branches?

- **Parallel Development**: Work on multiple features at the same time
- **Risk Isolation**: Experimental changes won't affect stable code
- **Collaboration**: Team members can work independently
- **Easy Switching**: Move between different features quickly
