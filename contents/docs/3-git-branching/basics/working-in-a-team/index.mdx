description: Learn about Working In A Team in Git

Working in a team on GitHub involves collaborative development using Git's distributed version control system. Team members can work on separate branches, create pull requests for code reviews, and merge changes into the main codebase. GitHub's features like issues, projects, and discussions facilitate communication and project management. Effective teamwork on GitHub requires clear communication, adherence to agreed-upon workflows, and proper use of Git commands to manage code changes and resolve conflicts. This collaborative approach enables teams to work efficiently on complex projects, maintain code quality, and track progress effectively.

GitHub also offers an organization and team management interface, allowing teams to manage projects, members, and collaboration settings.
