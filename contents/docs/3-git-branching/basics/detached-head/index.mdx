# Detached HEAD

In Git, a detached head occurs when you check out a commit directly using its hash instead of a branch name. This leaves your repository's HEAD pointer pointing directly at that commit, rather than being linked to a specific branch. To view the history and changes made in a detached head, use `git log` or `git show`. If you want to see the differences between the current detached head and another branch, use `git diff <branch>`. A detached head can be a useful temporary state for exploring specific commits or features, but it's essential to merge those changes back into a branch before sharing them with others.
