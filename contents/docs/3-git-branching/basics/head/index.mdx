# HEAD

The `HEAD` file is at the core of how Git knows the SHA-1 of the last commit when running commands like `git branch <branch>`. It serves as a symbolic reference, pointing to the current branch. However, in rare cases, HEAD can contain the actual SHA-1 value of a Git object, such as when checking out a tag, commit, or remote branch, which puts your repository in a "detached HEAD" state.
