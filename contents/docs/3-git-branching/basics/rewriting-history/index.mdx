# Rewriting History

In certain situations, you might need to modify or remove commits from your Git repository's history. This can be achieved using various methods:

- `git commit --amend`: Allows you to edit the most recent commit.
- `git rebase`: Replaces one branch with another, preserving the commit history.
- `git filter-branch`: Removes specific commits from a branch without altering the original branch.
- `git push --force`: Updates the remote repository while respecting existing pull requests.

Rewriting history in Git is typically necessary when:

- Fixing mistakes: Correcting errors or typos in commit messages.
- Removing sensitive data: Deleting confidential information from commits, like API keys or database credentials.
- Simplifying complex histories: Reorganizing branches to improve clarity and reduce complexity.
