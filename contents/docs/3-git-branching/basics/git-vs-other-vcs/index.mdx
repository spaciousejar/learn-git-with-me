title: Git Vs Other Vcs
---

Git has become the de facto standard for source control in software development, but it's not the only version control system (VCS) available. Here are some key differences between Git and other popular VCS:

- Mercurial: Mercurial is a distributed VCS that uses a similar architecture to Git. However, it has a more centralized approach and doesn't use hashes for tracking changes.
- Subversion: Subversion is a centralized VCS that's often compared to Git. While both systems support branching and merging, Subversion requires a central server to manage the repository.
- Perforce: Perforce is a commercial VCS that's designed for large-scale development projects. It uses a centralized approach and has features like build automation and issue tracking.
- CVS: CVS is an older version control system that's still in use today. However, it lacks many modern features and is often considered outdated.
