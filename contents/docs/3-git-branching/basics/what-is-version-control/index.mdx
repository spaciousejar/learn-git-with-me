# What is Version Control?

Version control is a system that manages and tracks changes to files over time, allowing multiple people to collaborate on a project while maintaining a history of all modifications. It records changes to files, such as code, documents, or configuration files, and stores them in a repository. With version control, developers can revert to previous versions, compare differences between versions, and understand the evolution of a project. It supports features like branching, where different lines of development can occur independently, and merging, which combines changes from different branches. Overall, version control ensures that changes are organized, recoverable, and easily managed, making it a critical tool in software development and collaborative projects.
