# git reset

Git reset is a command that allows you to "undo" or reset your current branch to a previous state by moving its HEAD pointer, effectively discarding changes made since then. When using git reset, it's essential to specify one of the three modes: soft, hard, or mixed. The mode you choose will determine how Git interacts with files in your working directory and staging area.
