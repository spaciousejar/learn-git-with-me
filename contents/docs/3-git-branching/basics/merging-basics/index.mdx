A merge in Git is the process of combining changes from one branch into another. When you want to integrate updates from one branch (the source) into another branch (the target), you need to perform a merge. This involves resolving conflicts between the two branches, if any exist. The goal of merging is to create a new commit that represents the combined changes from both branches, resulting in a single, cohesive history for your project.
