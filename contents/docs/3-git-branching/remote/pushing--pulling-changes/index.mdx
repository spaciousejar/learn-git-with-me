# Pushing / Pulling Changes

When you pull changes in Git, you're fetching and integrating changes from a remote repository into your local repository. This operation updates your local branch with the latest changes from the remote branch. Whereas When you push changes in Git, you're sending your local commits to a remote repository, such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. This operation updates the remote repository with your latest changes.
