title: Fetch Without Merge
description: Understanding the difference between fetch and pull in Git
---
In Git, you can **fetch** changes from a remote repository **without merging** them into your current branch. This allows you to review, compare, or manipulate changes *before* deciding to merge or rebase.

---

###  git fetch — Fetch Without Merge

```bash
git fetch origin
```

This command:

* Downloads **commits**, **branches**, and **tags** from the remote (`origin`).
* **Does NOT** merge them into your current branch.
* Updates remote-tracking branches (e.g., `origin/main`) locally.

---

###  Example Workflow

```bash
# You're on 'main'
git fetch origin

# Now you can inspect the fetched changes
git log HEAD..origin/main --oneline
# Or diff them
git diff origin/main
# Or test-merge them into a temp branch
git checkout -b test-merge origin/main
```

---

###  Remote-Tracking Branches

After `git fetch`, you’ll see updates in:

* `origin/main` → latest main branch on remote
* `origin/feature-x` → latest feature branch on remote

Your **local branches stay untouched**.

###  fetch vs pull

| Command     | What It Does                               |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `git fetch` | Downloads remote changes **only**          |
| `git pull`  | Does `git fetch` + `git merge` (or rebase) |

To fetch without merging, always use:

```bash
git fetch
```
