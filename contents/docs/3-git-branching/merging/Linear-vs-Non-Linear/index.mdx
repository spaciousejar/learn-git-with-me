title: Linear vs Non-Linear Merge
description: Understanding the difference between linear and non-linear merge in Git
---
When it comes to **merging in Git**, the terms **linear** and **non-linear** refer to the structure of the commit history that results from the merge process.

---

### Linear Merging

**Linear history** means the project history forms a single straight line—no branches sticking out. This is usually achieved by using:

#### git rebase

* It **re-applies** commits from your branch on top of another (like `main`), creating new commits.
* This makes the history look like the feature was developed directly on top of the latest `main`.

#### git merge --ff-only

* Ensures a **fast-forward merge** (only if possible).
* No new merge commit is created; the branch pointer just moves forward.

####  Benefits

* Clean, easy-to-follow history.
* Useful in smaller teams or personal projects.

####  Example

```bash
git checkout feature
# work done on feature branch
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
git checkout main
git merge feature  # fast-forward
```

---

###  Non-Linear Merging

**Non-linear history** means the commit graph contains merge commits and branching paths—more like a tree.

#### git merge (default)

* Creates a **merge commit** when two branches diverged.
* Preserves full history and context of parallel work.

####  Benefits

* Shows real collaboration and when branches were combined.
* Important in large teams or open-source projects where preserving context matters.

####  Example

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature
# Creates a merge commit with both histories preserved
```

###  Summary: Linear vs Non-Linear Merge

| Aspect              | Linear Merge                   | Non-Linear Merge         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Tools               | `rebase`, `merge --ff-only`    | `merge` (default)        |
| Commit History      | Clean, straight line           | Branches, merge commits  |
| Collaboration       | Less context                   | More context             |
| Use Case            | Solo work, small teams         | Large teams, open source |
| Conflict Resolution | Before merging (during rebase) | During the merge         |

###  Caution

* **Rebasing public/shared branches** can rewrite history and cause confusion.
* Always prefer **merge** over **rebase** for shared branches unless everyone agrees on rebase usage.
