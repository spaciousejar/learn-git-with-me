title: Git Revert
---

The `git revert` command creates a new commit that undoes the changes from a previous commit. Unlike `git reset`, it doesn't alter history.

## Why Use Revert?

- **Safe**: Doesn't change existing history
- **Collaborative**: Safe to use on shared branches
- **Traceable**: Keeps a record of what was undone

## Basic Usage

### Revert a Single Commit

```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
```

This creates a new commit that undoes the changes from the specified commit.

### Revert Multiple Commits

```bash
# Revert a range of commits
git revert HEAD~3..HEAD

# Revert multiple specific commits
git revert abc1234 def5678
```

## Options

### No-commit Mode

```bash
git revert --no-commit <commit-hash>
```

Stages the revert changes without automatically committing.

### Edit Commit Message

```bash
git revert --edit <commit-hash>
```

Opens an editor to modify the revert commit message.

## Examples

```bash
# Revert the last commit
git revert HEAD

# Revert a specific commit
git revert 9fceb02

# Revert without auto-committing
git revert --no-commit HEAD~2

# Revert a merge commit (specify parent)
git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>
```

## Reverting Merge Commits

Merge commits have multiple parents. Specify which parent to revert to:

```bash
# Revert to the first parent (main branch)
git revert -m 1 <merge-commit>

# Revert to the second parent (feature branch)
git revert -m 2 <merge-commit>
```

## Handling Conflicts

If conflicts occur during revert:

1. Resolve conflicts manually
2. Stage the resolved files: `git add <file>`
3. Complete the revert: `git revert --continue`

Or abort the revert: `git revert --abort`

## vs. Reset

| Aspect | Revert | Reset |
|--------|--------|-------|
| History | Preserves | Alters |
| Safety | Safe for shared repos | Dangerous for shared repos |
| Traceability | Shows what was undone | No trace of undoing |
