# Managing Remotes

In Git, a remote repository refers to a copy of a project's source code stored on a server or other machine.

- Adding remotes: Use `git remote add [name] [url]` to add a new remote repository. This allows you to track changes and push/pull updates from the remote.
- Listing remotes: Run `git remote -v` to list all configured remotes with their URLs.
- Renaming remotes: Update the name of an existing remote using `git remote rename [old-name] [new-name]`.
- Deleting remotes: Remove a remote repository with `git remote remove [name]`.

Managing remotes is essential for collaborating on projects or tracking changes from upstream sources.
