description: Learn about Viewing Commit History in Git
---
Viewing commit history is a crucial aspect of Git, allowing users to examine the chronological record of repository changes. This feature is essential for understanding project evolution, tracking modifications, and facilitating effective team collaboration. Git provides various commands like `git log` and its options (e.g., `--oneline`, `--graph`, `--patch`, `--stat`) to display commit history in different formats. Users can filter commits by author, date range, and other criteria. By regularly reviewing commit history and following best practices such as writing clear commit messages and using tags, developers can gain valuable insights into their project's development and make informed decisions about future changes.
