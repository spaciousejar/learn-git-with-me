# pre-push

Git pre-push hooks are scripts that run automatically before a push operation is executed, providing a final checkpoint to validate changes before they are shared with a remote repository. These hooks allow developers to perform last-minute checks, such as running tests, linting code, or verifying commit messages, to ensure that only high-quality and compliant code is pushed. By intercepting the push process, pre-push hooks help maintain code integrity, prevent accidental pushes of incomplete or broken code, and enforce project-specific rules, making them a valuable tool for maintaining code quality and consistency across distributed development teams.
