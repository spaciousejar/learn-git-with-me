The `git log` command comes with many useful options to customize the output and filter commits.

## Common Options

### Formatting Output

- `--oneline` - Show each commit on a single line
- `--graph` - Show a text-based graphical representation of the branch structure
- `--decorate` - Show references (branches, tags) that point to commits
- `--all` - Show commits from all branches

### Limiting Output

- `-n <number>` - Limit the number of commits shown
- `--since=<date>` - Show commits after a specific date
- `--until=<date>` - Show commits before a specific date
- `--author=<pattern>` - Show commits by a specific author

### File-specific Options

- `--` `<file>` - Show commits that affected specific files
- `--follow` - Follow renames when showing file history

## Examples

```bash
# Show last 5 commits in oneline format
git log --oneline -5

# Show commit graph for all branches
git log --graph --all --oneline

# Show commits by specific author
git log --author="John Doe"

# Show commits in last week
git log --since="1 week ago"
```
