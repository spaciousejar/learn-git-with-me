description: Understanding the Git staging area and staged changes
---
Staged changes are modifications that have been marked for inclusion in the next commit using `git add`.

## What Are Staged Changes?

The staging area (also called the index) is a holding area where you prepare changes before committing them. It allows you to:

- Select which changes to include in a commit
- Review changes before committing
- Create focused, logical commits

## The Three States

Git files exist in three states:

1. **Modified**: Changed but not staged
2. **Staged**: Modified and marked for commit
3. **Committed**: Stored in the Git database

```
Working Directory → Staging Area → Repository
     (modified)      (staged)     (committed)
```

## Staging Files

### Stage Specific Files

```bash
# Stage a single file
git add file.txt

# Stage multiple files
git add file1.txt file2.txt

# Stage all files with specific extension
git add *.js
```

### Stage All Changes

```bash
# Stage all modified and new files
git add .

# Stage all changes including deletions
git add -A

# Stage all tracked files
git add -u
```

## Viewing Staged Changes

### Check Status

```bash
git status
```

Output shows:
- **Green**: Staged changes (ready to commit)
- **Red**: Unstaged changes

### See Staged Differences

```bash
# Show staged changes
git diff --staged

# Alternative command
git diff --cached
```

## Unstaging Changes

### Unstage Specific Files

```bash
git reset HEAD file.txt
```

### Unstage All Files

```bash
git reset HEAD
```

### Using Git Restore (Git 2.23+)

```bash
# Unstage specific file
git restore --staged file.txt

# Unstage all files
git restore --staged .
```

## Partial Staging

### Interactive Staging

```bash
git add -i
```

This opens an interactive menu for selective staging.

### Patch Mode

```bash
git add -p file.txt
```

This allows you to stage parts of a file:
- `y` - stage this hunk
- `n` - don't stage this hunk
- `s` - split hunk into smaller hunks
- `q` - quit

## Examples

### Selective Staging Workflow

```bash
# Make changes to multiple files
echo "new feature" >> feature.js
echo "bug fix" >> bugfix.js
echo "documentation" >> README.md

# Stage only the feature
git add feature.js

# Check status
git status

# Commit the feature
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# Stage and commit bug fix separately
git add bugfix.js
git commit -m "Fix critical bug"
```

### Reviewing Before Commit

```bash
# Stage changes
git add .

# Review what will be committed
git diff --staged

# If changes look good, commit
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Stage Related Changes Together

```bash
# Good: Stage related files together
git add auth.js login.html auth.css
git commit -m "Implement user authentication"
```

### 2. Review Before Committing

```bash
# Always review staged changes
git diff --staged
git status
```

### 3. Use Descriptive Commits

Stage changes that belong to a single logical unit:

```bash
# Good: Focused commit
git add user-validation.js
git commit -m "Add email validation for user registration"

# Bad: Mixed changes
git add .
git commit -m "Various fixes and features"
```

## Common Scenarios

### Stage Only Part of a File

```bash
# Use patch mode to stage specific lines
git add -p large-file.js
```

### Accidentally Staged Wrong File

```bash
# Unstage the file
git reset HEAD wrong-file.txt

# Or with git restore
git restore --staged wrong-file.txt
```

### See What's Staged vs Unstaged

```bash
# See unstaged changes
git diff

# See staged changes
git diff --staged

# See both in one command
git status -v
```

## Git Status Output

Understanding the output:

```
$ git status
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
    modified:   staged-file.txt
    new file:   new-staged-file.txt

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
    modified:   unstaged-file.txt
```

- **"Changes to be committed"**: Staged changes
- **"Changes not staged for commit"**: Modified but unstaged
