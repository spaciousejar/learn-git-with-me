description: How to track empty directories in Git using .gitkeep
---
Git doesn't track empty directories. The `.gitkeep` file is a convention used to force Git to track empty directories.

## The Problem

Git only tracks files, not directories. If you have an empty directory structure you want to preserve:

```
project/
├── src/
├── tests/
├── docs/
└── assets/
    ├── images/  (empty)
    ├── css/     (empty)
    └── js/      (empty)
```

Git will ignore the empty `images/`, `css/`, and `js/` directories.

## The Solution

Add a `.gitkeep` file to empty directories:

```bash
touch assets/images/.gitkeep
touch assets/css/.gitkeep
touch assets/js/.gitkeep
```

## Creating .gitkeep Files

### Single Directory

```bash
touch directory/.gitkeep
```

### Multiple Directories

```bash
# Create .gitkeep in multiple directories
find . -type d -empty -exec touch {}/.gitkeep \;

# Or manually
mkdir -p logs temp cache
touch logs/.gitkeep temp/.gitkeep cache/.gitkeep
```

## Why .gitkeep?

- **Convention**: Widely recognized in the Git community
- **Descriptive**: The name explains its purpose
- **Empty**: Usually an empty file (no content needed)
- **Hidden**: Starts with `.` so it's hidden by default

## Alternative Names

Some projects use different conventions:

- `.keep`
- `.gitignore` (with content)
- `README.md`
- `.placeholder`

## Examples

### Web Project Structure

```
project/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── styles/
│   └── utils/
├── public/
│   ├── images/.gitkeep
│   ├── css/.gitkeep
│   └── js/.gitkeep
└── tests/
    ├── unit/.gitkeep
    └── integration/.gitkeep
```

### Build Directory Structure

```bash
# Create build directories
mkdir -p build/{debug,release,temp}

# Add .gitkeep files
touch build/debug/.gitkeep
touch build/release/.gitkeep
touch build/temp/.gitkeep
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Add Early
Create directory structure early in the project:

```bash
mkdir -p {src,tests,docs,assets/{images,css,js}}
find . -type d -empty -exec touch {}/.gitkeep \;
```

### 2. Document Purpose
Add content to .gitkeep explaining the directory:

```
# assets/images/.gitkeep
This directory will contain image assets for the project.
```

### 3. Remove When Not Needed
Once directories have real files, you can remove .gitkeep:

```bash
rm assets/images/.gitkeep  # when images are added
```

## Working with .gitkeep

### List All .gitkeep Files

```bash
find . -name ".gitkeep"
```

### Remove All .gitkeep Files

```bash
find . -name ".gitkeep" -delete
```

### Create .gitkeep for All Empty Directories

```bash
find . -type d -empty -not -path "./.git*" -exec touch {}/.gitkeep \;
```

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Log Directories

```bash
mkdir -p logs/{error,access,debug}
touch logs/{error,access,debug}/.gitkeep
```

### 2. Upload Directories

```bash
mkdir -p uploads/{images,documents,temp}
touch uploads/{images,documents,temp}/.gitkeep
```

### 3. Cache Directories

```bash
mkdir -p cache/{views,data,sessions}
touch cache/{views,data,sessions}/.gitkeep
```

## .gitkeep vs .gitignore

| Aspect | .gitkeep | .gitignore |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Purpose | Keep empty directories | Ignore files/directories |
| Content | Usually empty | Contains ignore patterns |
| Effect | Ensures directory is tracked | Prevents files from being tracked |

## Automation

### Script to Create Project Structure

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# create-structure.sh

directories=(
    "src/components"
    "src/utils"
    "tests/unit"
    "tests/integration"
    "docs/api"
    "assets/images"
    "assets/styles"
)

for dir in "${directories[@]}"; do
    mkdir -p "$dir"
    touch "$dir/.gitkeep"
    echo "Created $dir/.gitkeep"
done
```

### Makefile Target

```makefile
setup-dirs:
	mkdir -p logs temp cache uploads
	touch logs/.gitkeep temp/.gitkeep cache/.gitkeep uploads/.gitkeep
```

- Learn about [.gitignore](/docs/2-git-basics/working-with-files/gitignore) for excluding files
- Explore [staging area](/docs/2-git-basics/working-with-files/staging-area) concepts
- Understand [working directory](/docs/2-git-basics/working-with-files/working-directory) structure
