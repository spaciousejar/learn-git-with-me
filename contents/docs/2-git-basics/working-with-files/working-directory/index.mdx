title: Working Directory
---

A working directory in Git is the local environment where files are stored and modified as part of a project. It reflects the current state of the project's files, allowing developers to edit, add, or delete files. Changes made in the working directory can be staged for commit, which means they're prepared for inclusion in the next commit. The working directory is connected to the Git repository, and it helps manage the differences between the committed history and the current state of the files. It plays a central role in tracking changes, testing, and developing new features.
