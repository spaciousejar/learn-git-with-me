![Three Stage Workflow](/images/docs/2-git-basics/three-stage-workflow.svg)

The staging area (also called the "index") is one of Git's most important concepts. It's an intermediate step between your working directory and the Git repository, allowing you to carefully select which changes to include in your next commit.

## Understanding the Three Stages

1. **Working Directory**: Your local files where you make changes
2. **Staging Area**: A place to prepare your next commit
3. **Repository**: Where Git permanently stores your commits

The staging area gives you control over exactly what gets committed, even when you've made multiple changes to different files.
