Unstaged changes are modifications to tracked files that haven't been added to the staging area yet.

## What Are Unstaged Changes?

When you modify files in your working directory, Git tracks these changes but doesn't automatically prepare them for commit. These modifications remain "unstaged" until you explicitly add them to the staging area.

```
Working Directory → Staging Area → Repository
     (unstaged)      (staged)     (committed)
```

## Viewing Unstaged Changes

### Check Status

```bash
git status
```

Unstaged changes appear in **red** under "Changes not staged for commit".

### See Specific Changes

```bash
# Show unstaged changes
git diff

# Show changes for specific file
git diff filename.txt

# Show changes with more context
git diff -U10
```

## Types of Unstaged Changes

### Modified Files

Files that exist in the repository but have been changed:

```bash
# Edit an existing file
echo "new content" >> existing-file.txt

# Check status
git status
```

### Deleted Files

Files that were tracked but have been deleted:

```bash
# Delete a tracked file
rm tracked-file.txt

# Check status - shows as deleted
git status
```

### New Files

Files that don't exist in the repository yet:

```bash
# Create a new file
touch new-file.txt

# Check status - shows as untracked
git status
```

## Managing Unstaged Changes

### Stage Changes

```bash
# Stage specific file
git add filename.txt

# Stage all changes
git add .

# Stage all modified files (not new ones)
git add -u
```

### Discard Changes

```bash
# Discard changes to specific file
git checkout -- filename.txt

# Discard all unstaged changes (Git 2.23+)
git restore .

# Discard specific file (Git 2.23+)
git restore filename.txt
```

### Stash Changes

```bash
# Temporarily save unstaged changes
git stash

# Apply stashed changes later
git stash pop
```

## Working with Unstaged Changes

### Partial Staging

Stage only parts of a file:

```bash
# Interactive staging
git add -p filename.txt

# Interactive mode
git add -i
```

### Comparing Changes

```bash
# Compare unstaged changes
git diff

# Compare with specific commit
git diff HEAD~1

# Compare specific file
git diff HEAD -- filename.txt
```

## Common Scenarios

### Reviewing Changes Before Staging

```bash
# See what you've changed
git diff

# Check which files are modified
git status

# Stage files you want to commit
git add specific-file.txt
```

### Discarding Unwanted Changes

```bash
# Discard changes to one file
git checkout -- unwanted-changes.txt

# Discard all changes (be careful!)
git checkout -- .
```

### Mixing Staged and Unstaged Changes

You can have both staged and unstaged changes for the same file:

```bash
# Make changes and stage them
echo "line 1" >> file.txt
git add file.txt

# Make more changes (these are unstaged)
echo "line 2" >> file.txt

# Now you have both staged and unstaged changes
git status
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Review Before Staging

Always review your changes before staging:

```bash
git diff
git status
```

### 2. Use Meaningful Commits

Stage related changes together:

```bash
# Good: Related changes
git add auth.js login.html
git commit -m "Implement login feature"

# Bad: Unrelated changes
git add .
git commit -m "Various changes"
```

### 3. Test Before Committing

Make sure your changes work:

```bash
# Run tests with unstaged changes
npm test

# If tests pass, stage and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature X"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Changes Not Showing

If `git diff` shows nothing but you know you made changes:

1. File might already be staged: `git diff --staged`
2. File might not be tracked: `git status`
3. File might be ignored: `git status --ignored`

### Accidentally Discarded Changes

If you accidentally discarded changes:

1. Check if you have a backup
2. Look in your editor's recovery files
3. Use `git reflog` if changes were committed before

### Large Diffs

For large changes, use tools to review:

```bash
# Use external diff tool
git difftool

# Show file names only
git diff --name-only

# Show summary statistics
git diff --stat
```

## Git Status Output

Understanding what Git tells you:

```
$ git status
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes)
    modified:   file1.txt
    deleted:    file2.txt

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
    new-file.txt
```

- **Modified**: File exists and has changes
- **Deleted**: File was removed from working directory
- **Untracked**: New file not in repository
